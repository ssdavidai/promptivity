**Purpose:**

To highlight the importance of providing context and instructions for unfamiliar situations, similar to supplying AI with the necessary background.

**Materials:**

- Scene cards (define a time, place, or unusual setting)
- Task cards (e.g., “Organize a town meeting”)

**How to Play (2 players):**

1. **Setup:**
    - Player A draws a scene card and a task card.
    - Imagine Player A just arrived from that scene’s era/environment into our present.
2. **Instructions:**
    - Player A must instruct Player B on how to carry out the task here and now.
    - Include details (tools, steps) so Player B can document and act on it.
3. **Debrief:**
    - Discuss how the unfamiliar setting forced more detailed explanations.
    - Relate to AI: providing necessary context transforms vague prompts into actionable steps.
