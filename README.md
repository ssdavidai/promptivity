# Promptivity

Promptivity is a collection of interactive games designed to help users practice giving crystal-clear instructions, mirroring how we must guide AI with explicit, unambiguous prompts. The games are built using React and are intended to be both educational and fun.

## About the Project

Promptivity aims to bridge the gap between human communication and AI prompting by providing a platform where users can practice crafting precise and effective instructions. Through engaging games, players learn the importance of clarity, context, and constraints when communicating with AI systems.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [JavaScript (ES6)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptivity.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd promptivity
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open the app in your browser:**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, you will be presented with the home screen where you can select from three different game modes.

## Game Modes

### Alien Assembly

**Purpose:**  
To practice giving crystal-clear instructions, mirroring how we must guide AI with explicit, unambiguous prompts.

**How to Play (2 players):**

- **Roles:**
  - **Player A:** “Human” who knows the final structure (from the card).
  - **Player B:** “Alien Worker” who must follow instructions literally but will “play dumb.”

- **Instructions:**
  - Player A describes step-by-step how to build the shape using Play-Doh.
  - If any instruction is vague, Player B should misinterpret it.

- **Debrief:**
  - Discuss how you adapted your language.
  - Relate to prompting AI: clarity and explicitness matter.

### Teach Me

**Purpose:**  
To learn how constraints affect communication, just as specific rules and limits shape AI prompts.

**How to Play (2 or more players):**

- **Setup:**
  - Player A draws one instruction card and three constraint cards.

- **Rules:**
  - Player A must follow the constraints while explaining the instruction.
  - Player B (or the group) tries to guess the original instruction.

- **Debrief:**
  - Which constraints were hardest?
  - Relate to AI prompting: complex requirements demand creative, structured instructions.

### Task Master

**Purpose:**  
To highlight the importance of providing context and instructions for unfamiliar situations, similar to supplying AI with the necessary background.

**How to Play (2 players):**

- **Setup:**
  - Player A draws a scene card and a task card.
  - Imagine Player A just arrived from that scene’s era/environment into our present.

- **Instructions:**
  - Player A must instruct Player B on how to carry out the task here and now.
  - Include details (tools, steps) so Player B can document and act on it.

- **Debrief:**
  - Discuss how the unfamiliar setting forced more detailed explanations.
  - Relate to AI: providing necessary context transforms vague prompts into actionable steps.
