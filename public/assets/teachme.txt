**Purpose:**

To learn how constraints affect communication, just as specific rules and limits shape AI prompts.

**Materials:**

- Instruction cards (simple tasks like “Explain how to tie a shoe”)
- Constraint cards (e.g., “Use no verbs,” “Only metaphors,” “Sing it”)

**How to Play (2 or more players):**

1. **Setup:**
    - Player A draws one instruction card and three constraint cards.
2. **Rules:**
    - Player A must follow the constraints while explaining the instruction.
    - Player B (or the group) tries to guess the original instruction.
3. **Debrief:**
    - Which constraints were hardest?
    - Relate to AI prompting: complex requirements demand creative, structured instructions.
