**Purpose:**

To create an interactive experience where a player communicates with an AI that simulates a person from an unfamiliar time or place, emphasizing the importance of providing clear context and instructions.

**How to Play (1 player and an AI):**

1. **Setup:**
   - The player selects one scene card and one task card.
   - The AI receives a system prompt that defines its character based on the selected scene and task.

2. **Gameplay:**
   - **AI Role-Playing**: The AI acts as a person who has just been teleported from their original time/place into the present day. It only knows the world as it was in the specified scene and is confused by modern concepts.
   - **Initial Interaction**: The AI explains its sudden appearance and expresses confusion about the task it must complete.
   - **Player's Role**: The player helps the AI understand and complete the task by explaining concepts in terms relatable to the AI's background, avoiding anachronistic jargon.
   - **Communication**: The player and the AI interact through the chat interface, simulating a conversation between a present-day person and someone from a different era.
