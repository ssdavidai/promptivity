**Purpose:**

To practice giving crystal-clear instructions, mirroring how we must guide AI with explicit, unambiguous prompts.

**Materials:**

- Play-Doh (multiple colors, simple shapes)
- “Structure” card (shows a shape or object to build)

**How to Play (2 players):**

1. **Roles:**
    - Player A: “Human” who knows the final structure (from the card).
    - Player B: “Alien Worker” who must follow instructions literally but will “play dumb.”
2. **Instructions:**
    - Player A describes step-by-step how to build the shape using Play-Doh.
    - If any instruction is vague, Player B should misinterpret it.
3. **Debrief:**
    - Discuss how you adapted your language.
    - Relate to prompting AI: clarity and explicitness matter.
